💼 SmartSalary+: Employee Salary Prediction App
SmartSalary+ is an interactive Streamlit web application that predicts whether an employee earns more than $50K or less than or equal to $50K annually based on key demographic and professional features. It uses a machine learning model and explains predictions using SHAP values. The app also generates a downloadable PDF report and supports batch predictions via CSV.

🔍 Features:
Predict salary class (>50K or ≤50K) using a trained ML model.
Explain the result using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations).
Generate a downloadable PDF report of the prediction.
Upload CSV files for batch prediction.
